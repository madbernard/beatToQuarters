Implementation of the rules of Neil Gow's RPG "Beat to Quarters"

I'll be running a game of Beat To Quarters at a convention.  Somehow, years ago, I found the RPG, and I like cards in systems and I love tall ships.  However, I'm not certain how the odds work out, and so I made this javascript implementation of the rules so that I could run a bunch of simulations and get the odds without having to do math.  Also possibly my players will want quicker resolution than drawing cards affords...  Though of course the romance of cards has its own appeal.
